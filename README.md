# Introduction to Data Visualization

A very, very brief introduction to data visualization

| Section                   | Content
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------   |
| [Part I](part1.ipynb)     | Mapping data, working with color, using transformations   |
| [Part II](part2.ipynb)    | Storytelling with data                                    |

If you want to run the code in the notebooks, you can start an environment on [RenkuLab](https://renkulab.io/projects/cramakri/intro-data-viz/environments/new). Just accept the defaults and click "Start Environment". Once it is ready, you will have a JupyterLab environment where you can run the cells of the notebooks.
